to reviewers:
I worked on this in coffee shop without internet connection.  So didn't set up git until I got home.   That explains why there is only one commit.

I'm using a template to create new projects, so you'll see empty folders & files in this project.  This project had no server setup.

The files you need to know are scripts.js and specs.js.  The html is called starter.html.
